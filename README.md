# Python Data Science Course

Welcome to the **Python Data Science Course** repository! This repository will contain a series of Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and code examples that accompany a video lecture series on Python programming and data science. Most of the materials are based on the course "Data-Driven Problem Solving in Engineering" that I have taught at two colleges over the last few years. The general premise of the course is to provide undergraduate students who are not familiar with Python programming and data science with all the tools and knowledge they need to use Python to perform data analysis and develop machine learning models. The repository is mainly a place to share the required codes and datasets for the actualy video lectures posted on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@masoudmasoumi5486) under [Python and Data Fusion](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhD0SCr3Tf2SyF25E9HJC0h1DqnEEtc40&si=uQZD832yGPMGzmxB) playlist.
